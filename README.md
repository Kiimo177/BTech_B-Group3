sudo docker run -d \
  --name mynginx \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v /home/knoxkiimo/project/web:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
  nginx

-p 8080:80: Exposes port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on your machine.

-v: Mounts your local folder to the containerâ€™s web root.


2. View the page in browser

Go to:

http://localhost:8080

Or if you're on a different machine in the same network, use your IP:

http://<your-local-ip>:8080
